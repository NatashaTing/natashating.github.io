# About Me
My name is Natasha Ting. As of 2024 I am a first-year student in business economics at Indiana University. My research interests are environmental economics and IO. 

Outside of economics, I read, write, joke, hike, dance, and play some music. 

## Geography
I grew up in a little town in the West Coast of Malaysia. Outside of the little town, I have lived in Edmonton, Kuala Lumpur, Auckland, and Edmonton. I currently live in Indiana. 

# About This Blog
I've always had a lot to say and there were always avenues. I started this blog in the summer of 2018, 
just after 2nd year undergraduate studies, and had a long hiatus from 2020 to 2024. This blog will at some point become more professional.
