# About Me
My name is Natasha Ting. As of Spring 2026 I am a third-year PhD student in business economics at Indiana University. My research interests are political economy, IO, and environmental economics. 

Outside of economics, I read, write, joke, hike, dance, and play some music. 

## Geography
I grew up in a little town in the West Coast of Malaysia. Outside of the little town, I have lived in Bloomington, Edmonton, Kuala Lumpur, and Auckland. I currently live in Bloomington, Indiana. 

# About This Blog
I've always had a lot to say and there were always avenues. I started this blog in the summer of 2018, 
just after 2nd year undergraduate studies, and had a long hiatus from 2020 to 2024. This blog will at some point become more professional.
