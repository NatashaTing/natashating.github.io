# About Me
I am a student of economics in a masters program at UAlberta. I will one day have a business and a bit of impact.  

## What I do 
I like to think that I translate economics learnings into somewhat useful action items. I like simulating decisions the econ way in particular. I like reading about growth theories, econometrics everything, industrial organisation, financial economics.  

## What I sometimes do
I read, write, hike, watch one anime, and play some music. I listen to fair-to-good conversations. I love jokes. 
- I used to think I will become a music teacher.
- I used to debate competitively. 
- I used to travel quite a bit, especially during my 2 gap years after high school. 

## Hometown
I grew up in a little town in the West Coast of Malaysia. It now has over 5 digit resident count, but feels more like 5,000. 

# About This Blog
The 11, 15, and 17 years old me will be proud that I have always kept, and still have, a blog. Though she will wonder why I burned all the selfies. I started this blog in the summer of 2018 to say many things I thought smart to say. I like to document my thoughts and publish some writings here. I think at some point this will become more academic or professional.
