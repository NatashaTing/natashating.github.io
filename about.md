# About Me
My name is Natasha Ting. I am a masters student in economics at the University of Alberta. 
My research area is resource economics, environmental economics, public finance, and asset pricing.
I like to think that I translate economics learning into somewhat useful action items. 

Outside of economics, I read, write, joke, hike, dance, and play some music. For leisure, I debate competitively. 

## Geography
I grew up in a little town in the West Coast of Malaysia. Outside of the little town, I have lived in Edmonton, Kuala Lumpur, and Auckland. 
I currently live in Edmonton, the northernmost city in the North America (fun). 

# About This Blog
I've always had a lot to say and there were always avenues. The 11, 15, and 17 years old me will be proud that 
I've always had a blog. I started this blog in the summer of 2018, and it will at some point become more academic or professional.
