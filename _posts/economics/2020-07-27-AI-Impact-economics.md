This weekend's [InsideAI newsletter](https://inside.com/campaigns/inside-ai-23888/sections/ai-commentary-by-robmay-201190) 
included writer/venture capitalist/angel investor Rob May's commentary on how AI could change the laws of economics. 
Economic laws change overtime, May writes, and AI could drive changes into economic laws by augmenting the importance of 
knowledge curve, changing the concept of demand curve, and introduce data-driven discontinuities. It was interesting to 
see how a seasoned practitioner of the supply and demand in the knowledge marketplace sees the laws of economics.

Sometimes, I think, the power of economic law is that it is so all-encompassing (so vague) that it can accommodate most 
changes that time brought. Really, Adam Smith cannot be vague-er that what he said about the forces of the market still 
largely hold true after a few industrial revolutions, a few world wars and some communist revolutions. In microeconomics, 
the same form that production function take can express utility; the national GDP also symbolises the 
aggregate demand in the macroeconomy... They all seem to "commute". In addition, there are often schools of thought that 
argue with each other, the most famous being the Keynesian school and the Friedman school in matters of monetary economics, 
and of course, numerous others. Don't like this expression of the economy? Don't worry, you can always find another 
economist saying somewhat opposite things. Economics is so young, so vague, so shady, and so ambitious.

In seeing this post though, the foresight of economics rises to the thought.

<h2>Existing Knowledge and Discontinuity in Economic Models</h2>
The knowledge component needs not be introduced to supply functions, because it has been built into the most popular 
production function almost a century ago. The [Cobb Douglas production function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobb–Douglas_production_function), 
developed in the 1920's, incorporates the Total Factor Productivity ([TFP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_factor_productivity)), 
which models the knowledge, technology, or efficiency of a production unit in utilizing its capital and workers. 
The TFP can be dependent on the levels of the means of production, the knowledge of the production unit itself, or some 
other firms or the economic environment. In this way, people or economists can analyse the efficiency of production of a 
unit using notions such as returns to scale.

This extend nicely to the third point mentioned by the commentary author on data-driven discontinuities on the mathematics 
of economics. Mr. May raised a capturing point about the sudden elevation in performance given availability of data. 
It may not look like it, but there are existing numerous discontinuities in individual- or firm-level supply and demand 
functions, only smoothed over by aggregation or by assumption of continuity. If additional discontinuities on the 
individual or aggregate level do occur as driven by data, smooth step or other sigmoidal functions could come to aid in 
smoothing over them. More relevant phenomena like the network effect, in which a tipping point marks a jump in efficiency, 
can be captured by notion of returns to scale. In [this collection of thoughts](https://www.nber.org/papers/w24839.pdf), 
Hal Varian called the network effect demand-side returns to scale alongside other interesting phenomena.

<h2>Data As a Means of Production</h2>
Mr. May's commentary has contributed to the vast scape of Artificial Intelligence discussion. As for me, my personal 
interest is most stirred by data ownership. The fundamental means of production in capitalistic models are currently 
two: capital, and human capital.  Which one do data belong to?

Data cannot be capital until a clear definition of ownership is defined. Do we own our data? We certainly do not collect 
or enable generation many forms of the data without many of the technologies. For example, without map and GPS services, 
we cannot keep track of where we go down to the degrees. However, we do generate data and the data describe us. Data, 
if a form of capital, can technically be owned by firms. This is currently not allowed by the legal framework in many countries.

Is data a form of human capital, then? Do workers own them, and how do workers offer them for rent/wages? Again, this is 
vaguely defined legally, and in many cases not enabled by technology firms. For example, users currently do not get 
monetary reward by giving up our privacy on Facebook, but get an exchange of service, which is technically a barter system.

As the data economy develops, would we see the classification of data as new form of the means of production, introducing 
a new and fundamental twist in economics after 200+ years? It is truly an exciting prospect.
