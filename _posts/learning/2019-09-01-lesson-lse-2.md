My time at the LSE was short but rich with reflections on my own discipline.

The main thing that I learnt is, you won’t be surprised, that economics is great.
 

Economics is not just models! The public lectures, class lectures, works of local authors and from the school all showed 
how economics is a field with wonderful versatility and depth. I loved learning about economic philosophies, political 
economy, and reading LSE authors’ works on freedom. There is also applied economics in other classes, like how fair 
valuation is used in hedge fund managers’ pay and from there analysing their incentives. At a lecture by Professor 
Silvana Tenreyro, I learnt for the first time how solving the welfare loss minimisation problem subject to the Philips 
curve can lead to the target rate used in monetary policy. The lecture considered the criticism towards the Philips Curve 
and defended it with findings from a new study.

Before this, I was thinking to “diversify risks” by exploring other study fields. I discovered that a number of things 
(not much) come more natural to me than does economics, which shook my faith somewhat. I also thought of going into a 
field like technology just to show that economics students can do it. In addition, since there is hardly a prerequisite 
for postgraduate studies in economics or to do economics at all, the value of credentials in the discipline is not 
obvious. But if I had any doubts about getting a masters or further in economics, this trip eradicated it. A bit more 
understanding of the field somehow made me want it a lot more.

 

Secondly, I also learnt that economics is not special. Despite the tendency for economists to act special, economics is 
just a field based on other disciplines’ previous advances, and needs to cooperate with and learn further from other 
disciplines. If calculus had not been invented, the words of economics philosophers cannot be expressed in mathematics; 
if Lagrangian methods were not invented, we might not know how to maximize a thing. If the Age of Enlightenment did not 
happen….I guess people would never have thought systematically about why markets work, thus foundations of economics would 
never have been laid.

I was and am guilty of selective attention, looking only at good things about my discipline. But local authors have 
inspired me to also look at the weak and unreasonable side of economics. From our ridiculous assumptions of markets and 
behaviours, to a deeply ingrained equilibrium thinking, to frequently missed economic forecasts, there are so many things 
economics can learn from the sciences and the arts to enhance its own theories. Learning economics in isolation does not 
embellish, but weakens it.

 

But a large part of my inpirations came from the LSE’s location in London, where multiple scholars important for economics 
roamed the streets and wrote their critical works. Right beside the economics building is the Hunterian Musuem, where 
the left brain hemisphere of Charles Babbage is preserved. Babbage (1791-1871) was known widely as the first creator of 
the mechanical computer, but he is also crucial for the new statistical movement and the first industrial operations 
treatise on the economy of technology. I pass by the Lyceum Theatre daily, where John Locke lived while he was an advisor. 
I stayed far from the school but very close to the U.S. embassy, which is built on the site of David Ricardo’s late home. 
Further to the west at Hyde Park there’s the speaker’s corner, where speakers like Adam Smith and Karl Marx tested and 
spread their ideologies to some willing and not-so-willing listening ears. The city itself bustles with economic 
activities, and smells of financial markets. It is impossible not to breath and think economics in London.

My amateur pen-keyboard-manship does not permit a full expression of what I learnt this trip. Let’s just sum up the 
positives and the negatives in a utilitarian welfare function like a true market economist: with 
[notably rare exceptions](http://crookedtimber.org/2011/03/30/with-notably-rare-exceptions/), I conclude that economics is great.
