I have insolently listed my professors' blunders enough in the last two posts. But it’s always easier to be the one sitting and snickering, so I’d offer my own funny stories.

Once during a department mixer (where cheese and wine are copious), the associate chair, for whom I served as a research assistant in my 2nd year, asked me who I’m taking microeconomics class with. “Dan Brown, ” I pointed at my professor chirping in the background.

This wouldn’t be embarrassing for me if:

1. my professor’s name is Dan Brown; *OR*
2. (the associate chair does not know him, and did not co-author a paper with him; *AND*
3. her eyes did not flicker for a second to the wine that I was having. It was my 3rd of the day); *OR*
4. I realised my mistake on the spot, rather than the day after.

Now whenever I see her, I am reminded of the blunder, and my vow to NEVER have more than 2 glasses during serious socials.

Also during a department mixer, my first in this case:

 

I volunteered to be the event photographer.

Department chair: *sees my name tag*

Department chair: “Thank you for helping us to take pictures. Are you a new graduate student?”

Me: “No, I am an undergrad. And you are? “

I was fascinated by utility accounting when I first learned it. I really liked how we can measure how much we like one thing over another by identifying the slope of indifference curve. I spent quite some time getting familiar with the concept.

 

After a while, I was fluent in the language already, thus when a friend asked “where do you want to go for dinner?” I naturally replied “Your pick. I am indifferent. “

 

I meant that literally, because being “indifferent” is defined as when “either (or all) goods yield the same happiness” for me. I of course had to be precise.

But who in the world says that sort of thing? And who in the world says that thing, and forget about it until a year later? No matter how I try, I don’t recall who asked me for dinner option. She might have stopped talking to me now. I think this is how I lose friends.
