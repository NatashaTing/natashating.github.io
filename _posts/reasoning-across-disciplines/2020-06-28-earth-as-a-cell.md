&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What if the universe is unified as a large being, and earth is a cell? What if the higher power that humanity always 
imagined is a living organism, which has omnipotence over earth and every being within like how humans have power over 
our own cells? From the pungent gas a cow produces, to a distant noise, to human beings, everything on earth owes its 
presence to atoms. As all of us pronounce our own purposes, we rotate about our own axes while the earth travels on its 
orbit, rubbing shoulders with neighbouring cells like Mars, the milky way, and time. Only a little stretch of imagination 
is required to support this hypothesis.


&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; First, to quell immediate nihilist qualms, let’s assume that there is a purpose of existing in the immediate future, 
thus there is a purpose that I am thinking about this and writing this, and there is a reason why you are reading this 
(you need not spell it). Assume that the earth is a cell, its biomolecules include sea, clouds, atmosphere, flora, fauna, 
metals, other elements, and us. It takes energy that a sun delivers, and excretes waste gas, liquid and maybe in the next 
billion years a significant piece of dunk. This cell, earth, could exist in the trillions to hold a delicate balance in 
the universe. 


&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Next, pounder: what are humans here for? We lurk on the surface of earth and take its resources. We are made of complex 
proteins that operate with complex, largely unknown, algorithms. We convert things into energy, and produce more things 
with it. We produce waste and expertly hide them somewhere on earth. After the earth was born, we mutated from beings and 
waited for sometime before dominating it. We fought the natural forces that try to suppress us, and aspire beyond what we 
see. We dream to venture into space to make other planets our home. We may proudly call ourselves a virus. 


&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The virus—this virus—is an honourable attempt to thrive. There are a million more questions: Are we truly a virus or are 
we the friendly neighbourhood probiotic bacteria? Will humanity mutate and infect more cells to become a more noticeable 
nuisance to the larger organism? Is the higher being trying to eliminate us and our harmless little tricks with earth’s 
resources? Will humanity one day co-inhabit with the other biomolecules within earth and become a useful citizen of the 
larger being? when will earth realise its purpose, if ever? When a cell realises its own purpose, then it ceases to be a 
cell. When will that happen? In this hypothesis, not even the higher being knows.
